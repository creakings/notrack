blockparser.py
*Add more blocklists
https://isc.sans.edu/suspicious_domains.html - dshild low, medium, high
https://firebog.net/ - nice list and layout


*Create new script to get statistics of number of malicious sites queried.
 Maybe look for unusual patterns in high / low number of sites queried.
